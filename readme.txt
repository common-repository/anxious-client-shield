Show typing effect messages to your clients and prove them that you are working on the website. Make them happy and work in peace.
 
== Description ==
 
Most of clients want to see changes quickly, that's why you need "Anxious Client Shield".

They think that every change is easy. They will check the website many times per day to make sure that you are working on it. They will try to reach you by email, by phone, by skype and by any other possible way. Even if there is a little bug on the website they could see it as catastrophic problem.

You don't like to receive complains and when it happens you start to work over stressed because you know that you have to give urgent update. This situation could affect the quality of your work because in certain moment you just want to get rid of the project.

In order to solve this situation and because we are professional developers we created a simple message with typing effect that will act as shield between you and your anxious client.

When your anxious client will see it, they will see something new and it means: "developer is working on my website". It seems odd but believe me that it works. 

After all, **Anxious Client Shield** is good for both parts. You work in peace without stress and your client receives a high quality website :)
